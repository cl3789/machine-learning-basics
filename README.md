The following notebooks cover several basic techniques in Machine Learning (ML):

* [Numpy and Pandas](Numpy_and_Pandas.ipynb): Demonstrate basic data manipulation using numpy and pandas, including slicing, indexing, conditional manipulation.
* [Dimensionality Reduction](Dimensionality_Reduction.ipynb): Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE
* [Nested Cross-validation](Cross_validation_pipeline.ipynb): Provide a standard ML pipeline for parameter selection and model performance evaluation.
* [Supervised Learning](Supervised_Learning.ipynb): Support Vector Machine (SVM) for binary and multiclass classification.
* [Data Visualization](Plot_utils.ipynb): Customized data visualization function, including scatter plot, subplots. This notebook will be updated.
